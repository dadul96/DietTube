### Q&A
* __Does this add-on also block ads?__ No, I recommend you to use uBlock Origin.
* __Why is this add-on not in the Chrome Web Store?__ Because it costs money to publish an add-on there.
* __Why is this add-on not in the Edge Add-on Store?__ Because I don't use Edge and therefore I don't want to create an additional developer account for a browser that I don't use.
